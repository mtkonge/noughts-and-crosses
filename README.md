In this repository i made two different versions of a tic-tac-toe game

the first one (firstVersion.py) was a competition to see who could make a tic-tac-toe game the fastest with two of my friends. the code is not very clean since it was made really fast

the second one (secondVersion.py) i made afterwards which i both faster and cleaner but took longer time to make.
